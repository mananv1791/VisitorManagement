# VisitorManagement
WOC2.0 PROJECT

You create a folder for your project

mkdir repo 
You enter the folder you have just created

cd repo 
You clone the repository your project is in

git clone https://github.com/mananv1791/VisitorManagement.git


-------------------------------------------------------------

In this project i have removed api keys so this is just a basic idea about how can we make Visior Management system. So if you want to run this you have to give API-Key for message anf provide this mail-id from which you want to send mail to visitors.
